# üêî McCluckel's Drive-Thru
## Project Overview
The owners of the McCluckel's Chicken Sandwich Shop want to offer drive-thru window service. They've hired you to develop a workflow system that automates the process of taking an order, sending an order to the kitchen and receiving a response, accepting payment, and serving the food to the customer. Some parts of this solution have been built, but you need to supply missing elements and tie it all together in a working program. 

## Business Requirements
### 1. User Interface
1. Orders will be submitted via browser, using a simple HTML form.
2. Customers will see the results of processing on the screen for the following:
   1. Order details: customer name, order number, time of order, sandwich type(s), quantity for each, and total price)
   2. Current status of order
3. Customers will "pay" for their orders through the browser interface, typing the amount and clicking a "Pay" button. 
4. Upon completion of the transaction, the customer will receive an appropriate message (e.g., "Thank you," "Sorry we could not complete your order,").

### 2. Payment System
1. Full payment must be received from the customer prior to submitting the order to the kitchen. 
2. Overpayments will be used as tips, whereas underpayment will result in a canceled order and a refund.
3. If a payment is successful but the order cannot be fulfilled, then this will result in a canceled order and a refund.
4. All successful orders/payments are accumulated in the "cash drawer." Accumulate the exact full amount of the purchase only.
5. McCluckels does not give change. Any overpayments go to employees immediately and are not tracked. 

### 3. Process Steps
A successful order will have the following sequence:
1. Take order
2. Accept payment
3. Submit order to kitchen and receive food
4. Serve meal
5. Thank customer

## Technical Requirements
### 1. User Interface
1. Use an HTML form to gather the order details (sandwich types and quantity of each), along with a "submit" button. 
2. Use an HTML form to gather payment amount (input field) along with a "pay" button. 
3. Use an event handler on each button: 
   1. Suppress the default form submit button behavior.
   2. Gather the field values into an object or objects representing the current order.
4. Provide `<div>` tags with unique id attributes for you to target with innerHTML or textContent. 
   1. Greetings
   2. Order status
   3. Amount due
   4. Current amount in the cash drawer

### 2. Payment System
1. The cost of each sandwich will be stored in a pricing table, represented by a JS object. _NOTE: You can optionally store the price in the same object as the ingredients._ 
2. Your program will dynamically consult the pricing table when determining how much money to require for payment. 
3. Payment status can be tracked as a property on the current order object, e.g., a simple Boolean `payment:true|false`.
4. If an order is rejected, then 
   1. Payment status reverts to `payment:false`.
   2. Dollar amount is not added to the cash drawer amount.
5. If an order is fulfilled and served, then the dollar amount is added to the cash drawer amount and displayed on the screen.

### 3. Process Steps
Promises will be central to your asynchronous program. Each step will exist as a unique "promise" object, for example:
```
// Asynchronous promise event with 3 second timeout
function doSomething(orderNum){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if(orderNum){
      const msg = {
        msg: `Processing order number ${orderNum}!`,
      }
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(msg)
      }, 3000)
    } else {
      reject("You need an order number")
    }
  })
}
```
_REMINDER: A promise-based function will always return a `new Promise`.

1. Write a promise for each step in your flow:
   1. Take order - synchronous/blocking; do not use a setTimeout()
   2. Accept payment - asynchronous/blocking; use a setTimeout() delay between 2-5 seconds
   3. Submit order to kitchen and receive food - asynchronous/blocking; use `fetch` API (see below)
   4. Serve meal - synchronous/blocking, use a setTimeout() delay between 2-5 seconds
   5. Thank customer - synchronous/blocking code (this could be done without a promise)
2. Use the `fetch` API to submit your order to the kitchen. Your request will go to the URL as shown below:  
```
function kitchenCall(order){
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      fetch("https://yylsnf-8080.csb.app/prepare_meal", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify(order),
        headers: {
          "Content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8",
        },
      })
        .then((data) => data.json())
        .then((data) => {
          data.status === 1 ? resolve(data) : reject(data)
        })
        .catch((err) =>
          reject({
            msg: `FAILED TO MAKE YOUR MEAL! ${err}`,
            status: 2,
          })
        )
    })
}
```
    3. A successful response from the kitchen will include the image URL(s) to display on your HTML page. 
    4. An unsuccessful response from the kitchen will be a status of 2 and a message to display to the customer.
3. Link together your promises so that their execution relies on the success of the previous promise. Example:
```
takeOrder()
  .then((data) => {
    getPayment(data)
  })
  .then((data) => {
    kitchenCall(data)
  })
  .then((data) => {
    serveMeal(data)
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    document.querySelector("#orderStatus").textContent = err.msg
  })
```
4. Improve your code by using async/await - Which we'll learn about in Week 15

## Additional Advice
You have a great deal of flexibility with how you fulfill the requirements of this assignment. Your instructor will provide guidance along the way, and you can and should use the Slack channel for Q&A. 

### ChatGPT
You are permitted to use ChatGPT to help complete this assignment. However, if you use this AI tool, then you must also submit an essay of at least 250 words to describe how you used it, what the results were, and whether you found it helpful to your learning experience.
