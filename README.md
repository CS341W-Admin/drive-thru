# üêî McCluckel's Drive-Thru
## Project Overview
The owners of the McCluckel's Chicken Sandwich Shop want to offer drive-thru window service. They've hired you to develop a workflow system that drives the process of taking an order, accepting payment, updating inventory, cooking the food, and serving the meal to the customer. Some parts of this solution have been built, but you need to supply missing elements and tie it all together in a working program. 

### Getting Started
Follow the instructions under [Getting Started](#getting-started--1x-repo-configuration) to clone this repository and set up a dev branch.

## Business Requirements
### 1. User Interface
1. Orders will be submitted via browser, using a simple HTML form.
2. Customers will see real-time feedback for the following:
   1. Order details: customer name, order number, time of order, sandwich type(s), quantity for each
   2. Current workflow status (e.g., prepping, cooking).
3. Customers will "pay" for their orders through the browser interface, typing the amount and clicking a "Pay" button. 
   1. Failure to pay an adequate amount will result in order failure (see below).
4. Upon completion of the transaction, the customer will receive an appropriate message
   1. Success: Thank you notice with presentation of food (i.e., images of the food) 
   2. Failure: "Sorry" notice (e.g., "Sorry! We could not complete your order").

### 2. Payment System
1. Full payment must be received from the customer prior to submitting the order to the kitchen. 
2. Underpayment will result in a canceled order and a refund.
3. Overpayments get tracked as tips for employees. McCluckels does not give change. 
3. If a payment is successful but the order cannot be fulfilled for any reason, then the order will be canceled. The funds __do not__ get counted as receipts.
4. All successful orders/payments will be accumulated (session totals) in the receipts for the given product (e.g., regular, spicy, deluxe). 
   1. Accumulate the exact full amount of the purchases only, not overpayments. (Reminder: Overpayments go as tips to employees.)

### 3. Process Steps
A successful order will have the following sequence:
1. Take order
2. Accept payment
3. Update inventory _Note: This is tracked at a product name level, not at element level (e.g., buns, patties)_
4. Submit order to kitchen and receive food
5. Serve meal and thank customer

## Technical Requirements
### 1. User Interface
1. Use an HTML form to gather the order details (sandwich types and quantity of each), along with a "submit" button. 
2. Use an HTML form to gather payment amount (input field) along with a "pay" button. 
3. Use an event handler on each button: 
   1. Suppress the default form submit button behavior.
4. Gather the order form's field values into the `orderDetails` object.
5. Provide `<div>` tags with unique id attributes for you to target with innerHTML or textContent. 
   1. Messages
   2. Order status
   3. Order history
   4. Current sales totals (admin area in footer)
   5. Inventory levels (sandwiches remaining)

### 2. Payment System
1. The cost of each sandwich is stored in a pricing table within the `accounts` JS object. 
2. Your program will dynamically consult the pricing table when determining how much money to require for payment. 
3. If an order is __rejected__, then dollar amount __is not__ added to the "receipts" counter.
4. If an order is __fulfilled__, then the dollar amount is added to "receipts" counter.
5. The day's total receipts for each product shall be inconspicuously displayed somewhere in footer area.

### 3. Process Steps
Promises will be central to your asynchronous program. Each step will exist as a unique "promise" object, for example:
```
// Asynchronous promise event with 3 second timeout
function doSomething(orderNum){
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if(orderNum){
      const msg = "Thanks for your order, please standby..."
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(msg)
      }, 3000)
    } else {
      reject("You need an order number")
    }
  })
}
```
_REMINDER: A promise-based function will always return a `new Promise`._

1. Write a promise for each step in your flow:
   1. Take order
   2. Accept payment
   3. Update inventory _Note: This is tracked at a product name level, not at element level (e.g., buns, patties)_
   4. Submit order to kitchen and receive food
   5. Serve meal and thank customer
2. Use the `fetch` API to submit your order to the kitchen. Your request will go to an external URL as shown below:  
```
    fetch("https://1ouruk-8080.csb.app/prepare_meal", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(order),
      headers: {
        "Content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8",
      },
    })
      .then((data) => data.json()) //.json() is a promise
      .then((data) => {
        data.status === 1 ? resolve(data) : reject(data)
      })
      .catch((err) =>
        reject("Failed to make your meal!")
      )
```
3. Fetch API response handling:
   1. A successful response from the kitchen will include the image URL(s) to display on your HTML page. 
   2. An unsuccessful response from the kitchen will be a status of 2 and a message to display to the customer.
4. Link together your promises so that their execution relies on the success of the previous promise. Example:
```
takeOrder()
  .then((data) => {
    getPayment(data)
  })
  .then((data) => {
    updateInventory(data)
  })
  // And so on...
  .catch((err) => {
    document.querySelector("#orderStatus").textContent = err.msg
  })
```
5. Improve your code by using async/await 
6. Follow the instructions below for [Submitting Your Code via GitHub](#submitting-your-code-via-github).

Upon submittal, the instructor will do the following: 
- Review your code and make any comments on your pull request
- Merge the accepted code into the "main" branch of the remote repo on GitHub
- Close the pull request 

### Additional Advice / ChatGPT
You have a great deal of flexibility with how you fulfill the requirements of this assignment. Your instructor will provide guidance along the way, and you can and should use the Slack channel for Q&A. 

You are permitted to use ChatGPT to help complete this assignment. However, if you use this AI tool, then you must also submit a 250-word essay ‚Äî **in your own words** ‚Äî to describe how you used it, what the results were, and whether you found it helpful to your learning experience.

## Getting Started ‚Äî 1x Repo Configuration

   *NOTE: To execute these steps, you¬†can use the terminal window in VSCode, the standard terminal app (Mac) or command prompt (Windows), or a popular third-party terminal emulator (e.g., iTerm2 for Mac, PuTTy or PowerShell for Windows).*

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your local machine. You can check by typing this command in the terminal window:
    ```
    git status
    ```
2. If the git command is not recognized, then download and install Git for your respective operating system (Mac, Windows, etc.):
    [link to Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

3. Create a project dev folder called "DriveThru".

    *NOTE: This is where the code project will be housed. If you're on a Mac, then you should create this folder within the üî® Developer folder. If you're on Windows, you might want to create your dev folder somewhere within your Documents directory. You can create this folder by using the File Explorer (Windows) or the Finder (Mac). Alternatively, you can create it from the terminal window (like a boss) as follows.*  
    - Run `pwd` to reveal the current folder path. *Move to the desired directory/folder within the terminal shell, as needed.* 
    - Run `mkdir DriveThru`. *The folder is created.*
    - Run `cd DriveThru`. *You are now in the new folder.* 

4. Clone the GitHub assignment repo into your new project dev folder:
    ```
    git clone --single-branch --branch main [assignment repo url] .
    ```
    *NOTE: Be certain to replace this ‚Äî `[assignment repo URL]` ‚Äî with your actual GitHub repo URL for this assignment, and **do not forget the trailing space and period**, which tells Git to use the current folder. For example:* 
    > `git clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/CS122J/drive-thru-John-Doe .`

5. Create a new branch called "dev-drivethru" and perform a check-out with the following one-line command:
    ```
    git checkout -b dev-drivethru
    ```
**Conclusion:** You are now ready to work in the "dev-drivethru" branch of your local repository. When you have finished making code changes and are ready to submit this assignment, then proceed to *Submitting Your Code via GitHub* below.

## Submitting Your Code via GitHub

1. Confirm that you're on the "dev-drivethru" branch. If you're not sure, then use the following commands to a) see what branch you're on, and b) switch to "dev-drivethru": 
    ```
    git branch
    git checkout dev-drivethru
    ```
2. Make sure any new files have been added to the local repo. Use `git add`... to add files/folders selectively, or use the global command (trailing dot):
   ```
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit any recent changes within your local repo ‚Äî Do this *before* pushing your code:
   ```
   git commit -a -m "[your custom message]"
   ```
    *NOTE: Remember to replace this `[your custom message]` with your own message, such as, "Adding new code for drive-thru."*

4. Push your code to the "dev-drivethru" branch on the remote GitHub repository.

    *NOTE: If this is a first-time push, this action results in creation of the branch at the remote repo (GitHub) level; otherwise, this updates the existing "dev-drivethru" branch on the remote repo.*
    ```
    git push origin dev-drivethru
    ```
5. Log in at [https://github.com](https://github.com) and access this repo. 

    *NOTE: Your repo should appear in the left column when you log in. For more direct access, just follow the URL for this repo.* 
    
6. Perform the following steps to target your pull request: 
    - Click the "Pull requests" top menu link. *The Pull Requests panel appears.* 
    - Click the "New pull request" button. *The Compare Changes panel appears.*
    - Click the "compare" drop down-menu button. *A list of active branches appears.*
    - Click the "dev-drivethru" branch name. *GitHub automatically evaluates the selected branch against the main branch for any conflicts. If there are no conflicts, then a green "able to merge" message is displayed.*
    - Click the "Create pull request" button. *The "Open a pull request" input panel appears.*
7. Perform the following steps to finalize and submit your pull request:
    - Type a brief 1-line description for the request, such as, "Submitting code for drive-thru."
    - Use the "Write" textbox to leave any comments or questions about this exercise.
    - Click the "Submit" button.

**Conclusion:** You have completed the steps necessary to submit your code.
